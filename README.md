- 3,672 courses either paid or free
- Fields: Course ID, Title, Subject, Level, Price, Revenue, Subscribers, Reviews
  
## Tools: 

**Power BI** was used to transform data,create visualizations and a report

## Data Cleaning/Preparation

- Replaced missing values and removed duplicates
- Changed data types (e.g. date formatting)
- Utilized DAX formulas to create calculated measures to find total revenue derived from course
  
## Data Analysis

This analysis delves into Udemy's course performance, exploring:

- Revenue drivers and influencing factors
- Subscriber behavior and demographics
- Course popularity and subject area analysis
- Regional preferences and publisher strategies
- Impact of pricing and course levels on revenue trends

## Exploratory Data Analysis

This phase focused on gaining a deeper understanding of the Udemy course data by asking these research questions:

1. What drives revenue generation among top-performing Udemy courses?
2. How have Udemy course revenue trends evolved over the past five years?
3. Do subscriber demographics and behavior influence course sales, and if so, how?
4. Is revenue distribution evenly spread across subject areas, or are certain areas more lucrative?
5. What key factors(ie; pricing, course level, subject area) contribute to changes in Udemy course revenue trends?

## Key Findings

Key insights derived from this analysis include:

-  Web Developer Bootcamp and Complete Web Developer Course 2.0  generate the highest revenue and reviews on Udemy
-  Subscribers aged 25-44 account for the majority of course sale
-  Courses designed for "All Levels" and "Beginner Level" generate most revenue
- Free and lower-paid courses attract more subscribers but generate little to no revenue
- Courses with short durations had more subscribers while those with longer durations saw fewer subscriptions

## Recommendations

Strategic implications of this analysis include:

- Design beginner-friendly web development courses to capture the growing demand for entry-level skills
- Implement tiered pricing and discounts to maximize course subscriptions
- Leverage free introductory courses to showcase expertise and drive enrollment
- Develop content that aligns with industry trends and resonates with learners' career aspirations
